# Epoka_Clubs_DatabaseManagementSystem
This repository represents a collaborative effort undertaken during the first semester of the second year of my Software Engineering degree. This is a small project that encompasses the development of a comprehensive database management 
system specifically designed for Epoka Clubs. It encompasses the creation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), relational schema, and the implementation of the database using SQL queries.

## Project Highlights
- Group project: This database management system project was collaboratively developed by a team of Software Engineering students.
- Semester and year: The project was completed during the first semester of the second year of the Software Engineering degree program.
- ERD development: An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was designed to capture the relationships between various entities within the university domain, including students, faculty, courses, and departments.
- Relational schema: A well-structured relational schema was created based on the ERD, outlining the tables, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
- Database creation: The database was implemented using SQL queries, ensuring the creation of the necessary tables, defining primary and foreign key constraints, and establishing data integrity rules.
- Query development: A set of SQL queries was developed to support various operations such as data retrieval, modification, and reporting within the database management system.
